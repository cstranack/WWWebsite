            <p class="customerText">Wireless Waiter is a remote ordering platform that allows your customers to place
                and pay for orders at your venue using their smartphone. Wireless Waiter frees your staff from taking
                orders
                and payments, allowing them to do what they do best, provide great service to your customers. It’s
                simple to use and this guide should help you get up and running.</p>

            <p class="customerText">The Wireless Waiter team will have worked with you to get your venue set up on the
                platform. You can have any number of bars, food or merchandise outlets set up under your venue. If your
                venue
                is set-up for ‘Collection Service’ your customers will be presented with different areas at your
                venue where they may be located. Depending on their location, when they place an order, it will be
                automatically routed by the system to their closest outlet. If your venue is set-up for ‘Table Service’
                your customers will have been asked to enter their table or seat number, prior to placing their
                order, so you can deliver their orders directly to them, when they are ready.</p>
