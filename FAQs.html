                    on 'All done?' to take you to our 'Checkout' screen then you can click on the 'ASAP' timeslot and it

                    If your order has been modified before your venue's staff have started preparing it then you will
                    still
                    have the chance to amend your order and add new items. From the order summary screen click on the
                    'Amend' link and it will take you back to amend your order. If the venue has already started
                    preparing
                    your order then you won't be able to amend it, however, if you need to you can always just place
                    another
                    order for the required items.
